              Here´s a timeline of Rosalind's life:
            </h3>
            <section id="lista">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1920</strong>
                - Born in London, England
                </li>
                <li><strong>1941</strong>
                - Graduated with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College, Cambridge, and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong>- Receives a PhD for his thesis "The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal"</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong>- Joined at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'État in Paris as one of the fifteen chercheurs (researchers).</li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong>- She started working as a research associate in the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Biophysics Unit, directed by John Randall. She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of proteins and lipids in solution, but her work was redirected to DNA fibres because of new developments in the field, and she was to be the only experienced experimental diffraction researcher at King's at the time.<br><br>She immediately discovered that the DNA sample could exist in two forms: at a relative humidity higher than 75%, the DNA fibre became long and thin; when it was drier, it became short and fat. She originally referred to the former as "wet" and the latter as "crystalline".</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong>- In February 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a molecular model of the B-DNA. Based on Franklin's lecture in November 1951 that DNA was helical with either two or three stands, they constructed a triple helix model, which was immediately proven to be flawed. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical. Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the alpha helix by Linus Pauling in 1951, but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.</li>
                <li><strong>1955</strong>- Published her first major works on TMV in Nature, where she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length. This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist Norman Pirie, though Franklin’s observation ultimately proved correct.</li>
                <li><strong>1957</strong>- She applied for a grant from the United States Public Health Service of the National Institutes of Health, which approved £10,000 (equivalent to £256,495 in 2021) for three years, the largest fund ever received at Birkbeck. In her grant application, Franklin mentioned her new interest in animal virus research.  With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.</li>
                <li><strong>1958</strong>- Dies of bronchopneumonia, secondary carcinomatosis, and ovarian cancer.<br> Exposure to X-ray radiation is sometimes considered to be a possible factor in Franklin’s illness.</li>
